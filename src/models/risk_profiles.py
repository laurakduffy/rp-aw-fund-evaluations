"""Risk-adjusted expected value summaries.

Computes risk-neutral EV plus risk-averse variants from empirical draws.
Mirrors the informal adjustments from gcr-fund-evaluations/export_rp_csv.py
and the formal models from rp-distribution-fitting/risk_analysis.py.

Risk profiles:
  Informal adjustments:
    neutral  — risk-neutral EV (mean)
    upside   — truncate upper tail at p99, renormalize
    downside — loss-averse utility (lambda=2.5, reference=median)
    combined — percentile-based weighting + loss aversion (NEW)

  Formal models (Duffy 2023):
    dmreu    — Difference-Making Risk-Weighted EU (p=0.05, moderate aversion)
    wlu      — Weighted Linear Utility (c=0.05, low-moderate concavity)
    ambiguity — Ambiguity Aversion with percentile-based weighting (NEW)
